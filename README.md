# titanic_survival_exploration
The first project for the Machine Learning Nanodegree (MLND) at Udacity

It is required to predict if a passenger is going to survival given some features of his/hers, e.g., sex, age and social class. I act as a machine to manually tune the parameters using a Decision Tree strategy, to make the prediction accuracy higher than 80% (82.72%).
